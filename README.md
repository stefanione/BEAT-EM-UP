# BEAT-EM-UP
UNITY Game in which the player has to fight his way through enemies. We have two categories of enemies : 
  - minions which are represented by the skeletons. The all share the ID303 Dataset
  - BOSS which is represented by the samurai. It has the ID304 Dataset

The player has different functions such as a jumping button, attack button, heal button. It can move forwards and bacwards.
The purpose of the game is to defeat all foes.

The Datasets contain different columns regarding the player's overall status. Based on these the enemy can decide whether to attack the player, ignore the player or request help.
The BOSS's dataset is a bit more complex, containing 2 different actions : a different attack than the standard one which is triggered when the player has low health, and to heal, which is triggered when the boss's health is low.
