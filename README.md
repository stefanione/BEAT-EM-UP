The Datasets contain different columns regarding the player's overall status. Based on these the enemy can decide whether to attack the player, ignore the player or request help.

The BOSS's dataset is a bit more complex, containing 2 different actions : a different attack than the standard one which is triggered when the player has low health, and to heal, which is triggered when the boss's health is low.
